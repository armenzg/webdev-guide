# Introduction

This is a web development guide that gives some recommendations as to what tools to use
and how to help you get started. The main focus will be using ReactJs for frontend development
and Django for backend. There will also be information about CI (e.g. Travis) as well as DevOps work (e.g. Docker).

You can read the live documentation in [here](https://web-development-guide.readthedocs.io).
